UX: Maybe put an arrow in the direction the user will go when typing.

This makes it so arrows are useful - and make arrow just change direction instead of kick them to the next cell

:: Main things left to do

DONE) reduxify rack
DONE) make 'delete' hit up redux-undo
DONE) [wordlist] keep word hover on board when + is hovered over
3) [wordlist] play word
4) [rack] remove played words from rack
5) [rack] make it so that you can enter no more than two blank tiles
6) [board] note which tiles on the board (that style on the board) were played with blank tiles (so send back Z_, is this already stored in redux state?)
7) [board] make it so when you click on a tile you can press right or down arrow key
  - make it show input under direction arrows so you can capture that
8) [organize code] split up actions to different files (index got too big)
9) [style] style redo / undo buttons
10) [organize css] urg
DONE) [bug] fix  undo button dispatching 'set direction' action
12) remove all the commented out code
