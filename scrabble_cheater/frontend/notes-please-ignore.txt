:: Main things left to do

DONE) rewrite all components to use redux / higher order component pattern
DONE) reduxify rack
DONE) make 'delete' hit up redux-undo
DONE) [wordlist] keep word hover on board when + is hovered over
DONE) [wordlist] play word
DONE) [rack] remove played words from rack
DONE) [organize code] split up actions to different files (index got too big)
DONE) [style] style redo / undo buttons
DONE) [bug] fix  undo button dispatching 'set direction' action
DONE)[cleanup] remove all the commented out code
DONE) [UX bug wordlist] when you click undo, clear (or hide) the wordlist as its useless now. Make them re-fetch.
DONE) [Prod bug] websockets dont hit flask server on prod. (solution: proxy requests to websockets in express)
DONE) [rack] make it so that you can enter no more than two blank tiles
14) [board] note which tiles on the board (that style on the board) were played with blank tiles (so send back Z_, is this already stored in redux state?)
- will have to change logic to here https://github.com/Kadeem-Nibbs/Scrabble_Cheater/pull/9/files#diff-228da414c318c6c651b9876adfad84b6R25
to also include _ tiles since they are going to persist. need to change API for blank + existing tiles.
- add comment https://github.com/Kadeem-Nibbs/Scrabble_Cheater/pull/9/files#diff-d22a49afa2a09b24bf1dcf6815a93354 
that says 'see undo buttons for pattern for disabling button - need to wrap in span - pull that behaviour out into component if commonly need hover + disabled state buttons'

DONE) [board] make it so when you click on a tile you can press right or down arrow key
  - make it show input under direction arrows so you can capture that
16) [organize css] urg
17) [basic code quality] add propTypes
18) [test] add unit tests 
19) ?? done
