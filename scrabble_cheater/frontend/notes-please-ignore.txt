Enter value and click direction:
  CHANGE_COORDINATE_VALUE

  then

  MAKE_TILE_EDITABLE

Move arrow key any direction:
  if tile Value:
    need to:
      CHANGE_COORDINATE_VALUE
      then
      MAKE_TILE_EDITABLE
  if no tile value:
    need to:
      MAKE_TILE_EDITABLE

handleChangeCoordinateValue
  => need to fire off 
    MAKE_TILE_EDITABLE for next file
  

Handle backspace:
  use redux-undo and return to prior states


UX: Maybe put an arrow in the direction the user will go when typing.

This makes it so arrows are useful - and make arrow just change direction instead of kick them to the next cell

:: Main things left to do

1) reduxify rack
2) make 'delete' hit up redux-undo
