UX: Maybe put an arrow in the direction the user will go when typing.

This makes it so arrows are useful - and make arrow just change direction instead of kick them to the next cell

:: Main things left to do

DONE) reduxify rack
DONE) make 'delete' hit up redux-undo
1) [wordlist] keep word hover on board when + is hovered over
2) [wordlist] play word
3) [rack] remove played words from rack
5) [board] note which tiles on the board (that style on the board) were played with blank tiles (so send back Z_, this this already happens?)
6) [rack] make it so that you can enter no more than two blank tiles
7) [board] make it so when you click on a tile you can press right or down arrow key
8) [organize code] split up actions to different files (index got too big)
9) [style] style redo / undo buttons
10) remove all the commented out code
11) ?? done ??
12) one day in the distant future organize CSS better
