:: Main things left to do

0) move back to using template file for Flask so this shit works, or figure out more complicated way? (just use template)
DONE) rewrite all components to use redux / higher order component pattern
DONE) reduxify rack
DONE) make 'delete' hit up redux-undo
DONE) [wordlist] keep word hover on board when + is hovered over
DONE) [wordlist] play word
DONE) [rack] remove played words from rack
DONE) [organize code] split up actions to different files (index got too big)
DONE) [style] style redo / undo buttons
DONE) [bug] fix  undo button dispatching 'set direction' action
DONE)[cleanup] remove all the commented out code
11) [UX bug wordlist] when you click undo, clear (or hide) the wordlist as its useless now. Make them re-fetch.
  - maybe only includeAction 'rack change' whatever that action is (i dont think this would work but try)
12) [rack] make it so that you can enter no more than two blank tiles
13) [board] note which tiles on the board (that style on the board) were played with blank tiles (so send back Z_, is this already stored in redux state?)
- will have to change logic to here https://github.com/Kadeem-Nibbs/Scrabble_Cheater/pull/9/files#diff-228da414c318c6c651b9876adfad84b6R25
to also include _ tiles since they are going to persist. need to change API for blank + existing tiles.

- change // highlight it so they dont get 'stuck' to // UX improvement: highlight it so they dont get 'stuck' visually
- change // Force user to select a direction clicking tile to // Force user to select a direction
- add comment https://github.com/Kadeem-Nibbs/Scrabble_Cheater/pull/9/files#diff-d22a49afa2a09b24bf1dcf6815a93354 
that says 'see undo buttons for pattern for disabling button - need to wrap in span - pull that behaviour out into component if commonly need hover + disabled state buttons'
14) [board] make it so when you click on a tile you can press right or down arrow key
  - make it show input under direction arrows so you can capture that
15) [organize css] urg
16) [test] add unit tests
17) ?? done
