// Note: We are importing semnatic-ui styles from a CDN in index.html, and overriding the styles here. 
// Use the lowest level of specificity needed to overrwrite semnatic-ui's base styles.

// Not using !important is important because all global styles are imported here, 
//  but individual components may also have their own less file.

// This makes using new CSS classes in components to change styles (instead of !important) crucial, 
//  and _never_ using !important in global styles. 

// less allows us to do the following for chaining new classes, so it works nicely for specificity

//   .some-class {
//     &.some-chained-class {   // (added via state changes or whatever)
//       //
//     }  
//   }
